# Big-Data-Analyzing-10Gb-of-Yelp-Reviews-Data
### Introduction
We will be using a Spark Cluster on AWS EMR for loading and running some analysis on Yelpâ€™s Reviews and Businesses dataset (about 10gb) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset). We will run our analysis via Jupyer Notebook and the expected output arifact is a .ipynb file.

Then, we need to configure our Juypter Notebook.
